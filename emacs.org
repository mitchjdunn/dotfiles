#+title: Emacs From Scratch Configuration
#+PROPERTY: header-args:emacs-lisp :tangle ~/.config/.emacs :mkdirp yes
* Welcome!

This is the configuration we've been building in the *Emacs From Scratch* series, now written as an Org Mode document.  This file generates [[file:.emacs][.emacs]] which can be loaded by Emacs at startup.

The following variables are used to tweak some of the configuration pieces for use in the live streams so you might need to adjust them for your local machine if you try to use this configuration directly.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  ;; NOTE: .emacs is now generated from Emacs.org.  Please edit that file
  ;;       in Emacs and .emacs will be generated automatically!

  ;; You will most likely need to adjust this font size for your system!
  (defvar mitchymitch/default-font-size 180)
  (defvar mitchymitch/default-variable-font-size 180)

  (setq system-uses-terminfo nil)
  ;; start up in full screen
  (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(fullscreen . maximized))
#+end_src

* Tips for Use

In this document I've added links in many places that lead you to documentation for the various packages we use.  If you're looking at this file in Emacs, you can put your cursor on a link and press =C-c C-o= or run =M-x org-open-at-point= to open the link in your web browser.

* Package System Setup

Emacs has a built in package manager but it doesn't make it easy to automatically install packages on a new system the first time you pull down your configuration.  [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]] is a really helpful package used in this configuration to make it a lot easier to automate the installation and configuration of everything else we use.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  ;; Initialize package sources
  (require 'package)

  ;; Set package repos
  (setq package-archives '(("melpa" . "https://stable.melpa.org/packages/")
			   ("org" . "https://orgmode.org/elpa/")
			   ("elpa" . "https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/")))

  (package-initialize)
  (unless package-archive-contents
    (package-refresh-contents))

    ;; Initialize use-package on non-Linux platforms
  (unless (package-installed-p 'use-package)
    (package-install 'use-package))

  (require 'use-package)
  (setq use-package-always-ensure t)

#+end_src

* Basic UI Configuration

This section configures basic UI settings that remove unneeded elements to make Emacs look a lot more minimal and modern.  If you're just getting started in Emacs, the menu bar might be helpful so you can remove the =(menu-bar-mode -1)= line if you'd like to still see that.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (setq inhibit-startup-message t)

  (scroll-bar-mode -1)        ; Disable visible scrollbar
  (tool-bar-mode -1)          ; Disable the toolbar
  (tooltip-mode -1)           ; Disable tooltips
  (set-fringe-mode 10)        ; Give some breathing room

  (menu-bar-mode -1)            ; Disable the menu bar

  ;; Set up the visible bell
  (setq visible-bell nil)

  (column-number-mode)
  (global-display-line-numbers-mode t)

  ;; Disable line numbers for some modes
  (dolist (mode '(org-mode-hook
		  term-mode-hook
		  shell-mode-hook
		  eshell-mode-hook))
    (add-hook mode (lambda () (display-line-numbers-mode 0))))

#+end_src

* Keybinding Configuration

This configuration uses [[https://evil.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html][evil-mode]] for a Vi-like modal editing experience.  [[https://github.com/noctuid/general.el][general.el]] is used for easy keybinding configuration that integrates well with which-key.  [[https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil-collection][evil-collection]] is used to automatically configure various Emacs modes with Vi-like keybindings for evil-mode.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  ;; Make ESC quit prompts
  (global-set-key (kbd "<escape>") 'keyboard-escape-quit)

  (use-package general
    :config
    (general-create-definer rune/leader-keys
      :keymaps '(normal insert visual emacs)
      :prefix "SPC"
      :global-prefix "C-SPC")

    (rune/leader-keys
      "t"  '(:ignore t :which-key "toggles")
      "tt" '(counsel-load-theme :which-key "choose theme")
      "o" '(:ignore t :which-key "org")
      "oa" '(org-agenda :which-key "org-agenda")
      "oc" '(org-capture :which-key "org-capture")))

  ;; these are in Transient settings
  ;;(rune/leader-keys
  ;;  "ts" '(hydra-text-scale/body :which-key "scale text"))

  (use-package evil
    :init
    (setq evil-want-integration t)
    (setq evil-want-keybinding nil)
    (setq evil-want-C-u-scroll t)
    (setq evil-want-C-i-jump nil)

    (evil-mode 1)
    (define-key evil-insert-state-map (kbd "C-g") 'evil-normal-state)
    (define-key evil-insert-state-map (kbd "C-h") 'evil-delete-backward-char-and-join)

    ;; Use visual line motions even outside of visual-line-mode buffers
    (evil-global-set-key 'motion "j" 'evil-next-visual-line)
    (evil-global-set-key 'motion "k" 'evil-previous-visual-line)

    (evil-set-initial-state 'messages-buffer-mode 'normal)

* UI Configuration
** Color Theme

[[https://github.com/hlissner/emacs-doom-themes][doom-themes]] is a great set of themes with a lot of variety and support for many different Emacs modes.  Taking a look at the [[https://github.com/hlissner/emacs-doom-themes/tree/screenshots][screenshots]] might help you decide which one you like best.  You can also run =M-x counsel-load-theme= to choose between them easily.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  ;; lol not a doom theme
  (use-package doom-themes
    :init (load-theme 'doom-gruvbox t))
  ;; I like misterioso 

#+end_src

** Better Modeline

[[https://github.com/seagle0128/doom-modeline][doom-modeline]] is a very attractive and rich (yet still minimal) mode line configuration for Emacs.  The default configuration is quite good but you can check out the [[https://github.com/seagle0128/doom-modeline#customize][configuration options]] for more things you can enable or disable.

*NOTE:* The first time you load your configuration on a new machine, you'll need to run `M-x all-the-icons-install-fonts` so that mode line icons display correctly.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

(use-package all-the-icons)

(use-package doom-modeline
  :init (doom-modeline-mode 1)
  :custom ((doom-modeline-height 10)))

#+end_src

** Which Key

[[https://github.com/justbur/emacs-which-key][which-key]] is a useful UI panel that appears when you start pressing any key binding in Emacs to offer you all possible completions for the prefix.  For example, if you press =C-c= (hold control and press the letter =c=), a panel will appear at the bottom of the frame displaying all of the bindings under that prefix and which command they run.  This is very useful for learning the possible key bindings in the mode of your current buffer.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

(use-package which-key
  :init (which-key-mode)
  :diminish which-key-mode
  :config
  (setq which-key-idle-delay 1))

#+end_src

** Ivy and Counsel

[[https://oremacs.com/swiper/][Ivy]] is an excellent completion framework for Emacs.  It provides a minimal yet powerful selection menu that appears when you open files, switch buffers, and for many other tasks in Emacs.  Counsel is a customized set of commands to replace `find-file` with `counsel-find-file`, etc which provide useful commands for each of the default completion commands.

[[https://github.com/Yevgnen/ivy-rich][ivy-rich]] adds extra columns to a few of the Counsel commands to provide more information about each item.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package ivy
    :diminish
    :bind (("C-s" . swiper)
	   :map ivy-minibuffer-map
	   ("TAB" . ivy-alt-done)
	   ("C-l" . ivy-immediate-done)
	   ("C-j" . ivy-next-line)
	   ("C-k" . ivy-previous-line)
	   :map ivy-switch-buffer-map
	   ("C-k" . ivy-previous-line)
	   ("C-l" . ivy-done)
	   ("C-d" . ivy-switch-buffer-kill)
	   :map ivy-reverse-i-search-map
	   ("C-k" . ivy-previous-line)
	   ("C-d" . ivy-reverse-i-search-kill))
    :config
    (ivy-mode 1))

  (use-package ivy-rich
    :init
    (ivy-rich-mode 1))

  (use-package counsel
    :bind (("M-x" . counsel-M-x)
       ("C-x b" . counsel-ibuffer)
       ("C-x C-f" . counsel-find-file)
       ("C-M-j" . 'counsel-switch-buffer)
       :map minibuffer-local-map
       ("C-r" . 'counsel-minibuffer-history))
    :config
    (counsel-mode 1))

#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: counsel-minibuffer-history

** Helpful Help Commands

[[https://github.com/Wilfred/helpful][Helpful]] adds a lot of very helpful (get it?) information to Emacs' =describe-= command buffers.  For example, if you use =describe-function=, you will not only get the documentation about the function, you will also see the source code of the function and where it gets used in other places in the Emacs configuration.  It is very useful for figuring out how things work in Emacs.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package helpful
    :custom
    (counsel-describe-function-function #'helpful-callable)
    (counsel-describe-variable-function #'helpful-variable)
    :bind
    ([remap describe-function] . counsel-describe-function)
    ([remap describe-command] . helpful-command)
    ([remap describe-variable] . counsel-describe-variable)
    ([remap describe-key] . helpful-key))

#+end_src

** Transient Commands

This is an example of using [[https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra][Hydra]] to design a transient key binding for quickly adjusting the scale of the text on screen.  We define a hydra that is bound to =C-s t s= and, once activated, =j= and =k= increase and decrease the text scale.  You can press any other key (or =f= specifically) to exit the transient key map.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package hydra)

  (defhydra hydra-text-scale (:timeout 4)
    "scale text"
    ("j" text-scale-increase "in")
    ("k" text-scale-decrease "out")
    ("f" nil "finished" :exit t))

  (rune/leader-keys
    "ts" '(hydra-text-scale/body :which-key "scale text"))

#+end_src

** TreeMacs
Treemacs [[https://github.com/Alexander-Miller/treemacs][documentation]]
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  ;; (use-package treemacs-evil)
  ;; (use-package treemacs-projectile)
#+end_src
* Org Mode

[[https://orgmode.org/][Org Mode]] is one of the hallmark features of Emacs.  It is a rich document editor, project planner, task and time tracker, blogging engine, and literate coding utility all wrapped up in one package.

** Basic Config

This section contains the basic configuration for =org-mode= plus the configuration for Org agendas and capture templates.  There's a lot to unpack in here so I'd recommend watching the videos for [[https://youtu.be/VcgjTEa0kU4][Part 5]] and [[https://youtu.be/PNE-mgkZ6HM][Part 6]] for a full explanation.

#+RESULTS:

*** Nicer Heading Bullets

[[https://github.com/sabof/org-bullets][org-bullets]] replaces the heading stars in =org-mode= buffers with nicer looking characters that you can control.  Another option for this is [[https://github.com/integral-dw/org-superstar-mode][org-superstar-mode]] which we may cover in a later video.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

#+end_src

*** Center Org Buffers

We use [[https://github.com/joostkremers/visual-fill-column][visual-fill-column]] to center =org-mode= buffers for a more pleasing writing experience as it centers the contents of the buffer horizontally to seem more like you are editing a document.  This is really a matter of personal preference so you can remove the block below if you don't like the behavior.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (defun mitchymitch/org-mode-visual-fill ()
    (setq visual-fill-column-width 100
          visual-fill-column-center-text t)
    (visual-fill-column-mode 1))

  (use-package visual-fill-column
    :hook (org-mode . mitchymitch/org-mode-visual-fill))

#+end_src

** Better Font Faces

The =mitchymitch/org-font-setup= function configures various text faces to tweak the sizes of headings and use variable width fonts in most cases so that it looks more like we're editing a document in =org-mode=.  We switch back to fixed width (monospace) fonts for code blocks and tables so that they display correctly.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (require 'org-faces)

  (Defun mitchymitch/org-font-setup ()
    ;; Replace list hyphen with dot

** Configure Babel Languages

To execute or export code in =org-mode= code blocks, you'll need to set up =org-babel-load-languages= for each language you'd like to use.  [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/languages.html][This page]] documents all of the languages that you can use with =org-babel=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (org-babel-do-load-languages
    'org-babel-load-languages
    '((emacs-lisp . t)
      (python . t)))

** Structure Templates

Org Mode's [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Structure-Templates.html][structure templates]] feature enables you to quickly insert code blocks into your Org files in combination with =org-tempo= by typing =<= followed by the template name like =el= or =py= and then press =TAB=.  For example, to insert an empty =emacs-lisp= block below, you can type =<el= and press =TAB= to expand into such a block.

You can add more =src= block templates below by copying one of the lines and changing the two strings at the end, the first to be the template name and the second to contain the name of the language [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/languages.html][as it is known by Org Babel]].

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

** Auto-tangle Configuration Files

This snippet adds a hook to =org-mode= buffers so that =mitchymitch/org-babel-tangle-config= gets executed each time such a buffer gets saved.  This function checks to see if the file being saved is the Emacs.org file you're looking at right now, and if so, automatically exports the configuration here to the associated output files.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  ;; Automatically tangle our Emacs.org config file when we save it

** Rainbow Delimiters

[[https://github.com/Fanael/rainbow-delimiters][rainbow-delimiters]] is useful in programming modes because it colorizes nested parentheses and brackets according to their nesting depth.  This makes it a lot easier to visually match parentheses in Emacs Lisp code without having to count them yourself.

** LSP
 We use the excellent lsp-mode to enable IDE-like functionality for many different programming languages via “language servers” that speak the Language Server Protocol. Before trying to set up lsp-mode for a particular language, check out the documentation for your language so that you can learn which language servers are available and how to install them.

The lsp-keymap-prefix setting enables you to define a prefix for where lsp-mode’s default keybindings will be added. I highly recommend using the prefix to find out what you can do with lsp-mode in a buffer.

The which-key integration adds helpful descriptions of the various keys so you should be able to learn a lot just by pressing C-c l in a lsp-mode buffer and trying different things that you find there.

*** lsp-ui
lsp-ui is a set of UI enhancements built on top of lsp-mode which make Emacs feel even more like an IDE. Check out the screenshots on the lsp-ui homepage (linked at the beginning of this paragraph) to see examples of what it can do.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package lsp-ui
  :config
  (setq lsp-ui-doc-enable nil

*** lsp-treemacs
lsp-treemacs provides nice tree views for different aspects of your code like symbols in a file, references of a symbol, or diagnostic messages (errors and warnings) that are found in your code.

Try these commands with M-x:

    lsp-treemacs-symbols - Show a tree view of the symbols in the current file
    lsp-treemacs-references - Show a tree view for the references of the symbol under the cursor
    lsp-treemacs-error-list - Show a tree view for the diagnostic messages in the project

This package is built on the treemacs package which might be of some interest to you if you like to have a file browser at the left side of your screen in your editor.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

#+end_src

*** lsp-ivy
lsp-ivy integrates Ivy with lsp-mode to make it easy to search for things by name in your code. When you run these commands, a prompt will appear in the minibuffer allowing you to type part of the name of a symbol in your code. Results will be populated in the minibuffer so that you can find what you’re looking for and jump to that location in the code upon selecting the result.

Try these commands with M-x:

    lsp-ivy-workspace-symbol - Search for a symbol name in the current project workspace
    lsp-ivy-global-workspace-symbol - Search for a symbol name in all active project workspaces

* File Management

** Dired

   Dired is a built-in file manager for Emacs that does some pretty amazing things!  Here are some key bindings you should try out:

*** Key Bindings

**** Navigation

*Emacs* / *Evil*
- =n= / =j= - next line
- =p= / =k= - previous line
- =j= / =J= - jump to file in buffer
- =RET= - select file or directory
- =^= - go to parent directory
- =S-RET= / =g O= - Open file in "other" window
- =M-RET= - Show file in other window without focusing (previewing files)
- =g o= (=dired-view-file=) - Open file but in a "preview" mode, close with =q=
- =g= / =g r= Refresh the buffer with =revert-buffer= after changing configuration (and after filesystem changes!)

**** Marking files

- =m= - Marks a file
- =u= - Unmarks a file
- =U= - Unmarks all files in buffer
- =* t= / =t= - Inverts marked files in buffer
- =% m= - Mark files in buffer using regular expression
- =*= - Lots of other auto-marking functions
- =k= / =K= - "Kill" marked items (refresh buffer with =g= / =g r= to get them back)
- Many operations can be done on a single file if there are no active marks!
 
**** Copying and Renaming files

- =C= - Copy marked files (or if no files are marked, the current file)
- Copying single and multiple files
- =U= - Unmark all files in buffer
- =R= - Rename marked files, renaming multiple is a move!
- =% R= - Rename based on regular expression: =^test= , =old-\&=

*Power command*: =C-x C-q= (=dired-toggle-read-only=) - Makes all file names in the buffer editable directly to rename them!  Press =Z Z= to confirm renaming or =Z Q= to abort.

**** Deleting files

- =D= - Delete marked file
- =d= - Mark file for deletion
- =x= - Execute deletion for marks
- =delete-by-moving-to-trash= - Move to trash instead of deleting permanently

**** Creating and extracting archives

- =Z= - Compress or uncompress a file or folder to (=.tar.gz=)
- =c= - Compress selection to a specific file
- =dired-compress-files-alist= - Bind compression commands to file extension

**** Other common operations

- =T= - Touch (change timestamp)
- =M= - Change file mode
- =O= - Change file owner
- =G= - Change file group
- =S= - Create a symbolic link to this file
- =L= - Load an Emacs Lisp file into Emacs

*** Configuration
